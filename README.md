## Overview
This report compares the speed of different implementations of the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. It can be presented mathematically as:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

The first few numbers in the Fibonacci series are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

In this report, we will compare the speed of three different algorithms to find the nth number in the Fibonacci series:

The iterative approach calculates the nth number by starting from the first two numbers in the series and iteratively calculating the next number until the nth number is reached. The recursive approach uses a recursive function to calculate the nth number by summing the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers in the series. The dynamic programming approach stores the previously calculated numbers in an array to avoid recalculating them, resulting in a faster execution time.

To compare the algorithms, we will find the nth number of the Fibonacci series for a range of values of n, from 1 to 100. We will then measure the execution time of each algorithm and compare their performance.

There are multiple ways to implement the Fibonacci Series with code, each discussed in more detail below. However, for the implementations used in this report, the following chart represents the Big O value.
